# Minimalist TypeScript webpack Starter

This is a bare minimum starter kit to get you going with your [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) experiments.

It includes the setup needed to compile your TypeScript code and enable live reloads and nothing else. The goal is to get you as close to File -> New -> write **your** code -> F5 (or whatever your editor of choice does) as possible. **And that's it**. No fancy plugins, no linting, no unit testing... Just start coding in seconds and graduate to a more advanced setup or discard the project when you are done.

## Prerequisites

All you need to get started is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
